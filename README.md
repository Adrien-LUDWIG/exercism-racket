# xRacket

Exercism problems in Racket.

## Working on Problems

We welcome both improvements to the existing exercises and the addition of new exercises. A pool of exercise ideas can be found in the [x-common repo](https://github.com/exercism/x-common).

Each problem should have a test suite and an example solution, as well as a stub file for the solution declaring the module and exports. The example solution should be named =example.rkt=.
